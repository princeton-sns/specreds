## Part 4: replaying recovery traces and e2e simulation (Figures 5 and 6)

(This part takes around 30 minutes to complete)

In part 4, we will reproduce Figures 5 and 6 (bar figures in Section 5.3 and 5.4) in the paper. These two sections measures the latency of running application recovery workloads on the three types of disks (`rbd`, `super`, and `rbd-clone`)

Now, please proceed to [Part 5](https://github.com/princeton-sns/specreds/blob/main/p5perfafter.md).
